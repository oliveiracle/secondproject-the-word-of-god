    <h2>Who is Jesus?</h2>
    <p>
      Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the greatest expression of love humanity has ever known. Out of compassion for us, He left the glory of heaven and entered our world, born in a humble manger in Bethlehem. Though He is King of kings, He came not with riches or armies, but with gentleness and humility, showing that true greatness is found in serving others.
    <p>
      He lived a perfect and sinless life, walking among ordinary people, teaching about God’s Kingdom, and revealing the Father’s heart. He healed the sick, gave sight to the blind, raised the dead, and welcomed the outcast. Yet even more powerful than His miracles was the love He showed—a love that forgives sins, restores broken lives, and embraces every person who turns to Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cross, Jesus carried the weight of our sin and shame. He willingly gave His life as a sacrifice so that we could be reconciled with God. No nails held Him there—it was His love for us. In His suffering, we see the depth of God’s mercy; in His death, we find the price of our freedom. And on the third day, He rose from the grave, conquering death and offering us victory through His resurrection.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      His message is timeless: that no one is too far from His mercy, no past is too dark for His light, and no heart is beyond the reach of His grace. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life, and in Him we discover hope that never ends. To know Him is to know true love. To follow Him is to walk in freedom. And to believe in Him is to receive life everlasting in the presence of God.
    <blockquote>
      "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
       <blockquote>
